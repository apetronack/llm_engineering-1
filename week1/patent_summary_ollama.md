This is a software development project that generates code for an intravascular lithotripsy system. The project involves writing code in various programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

The generated code includes:

1. Device hardware design: The code includes specifications for the device's electrical power system, which includes an AC mains and a DC power storage system.
2. IVL operations: The code includes specifications for high-voltage pulses provided to the at least one set of electrodes during IVL operations.
3. Electrical power system: The code includes specifications for selectively providing power from the AC mains or the DC power storage system for IVL operations.

The project also involves testing and validation of the generated code to ensure its correctness and reliability.

Overall, this is a complex software development project that requires expertise in multiple areas, including electrical engineering, computer science, and programming. The project's scope and complexity suggest that it may require significant resources and time to complete.

**Code Generation**

The code generation process involves writing code in various programming languages, including:

1. C++: For the device hardware design, including specifications for the electrical power system.
2. Java: For the IVL operations, including specifications for high-voltage pulses provided to the at least one set of electrodes.
3. Python: For testing and validation of the generated code.
4. JavaScript: For user interface and application development.

**Code Structure**

The generated code is organized into the following modules:

1. Electrical Power System Module
2. IVL Operations Module
3. Device Hardware Design Module

Each module includes specifications for its respective function, including hardware design, software implementation, and testing procedures.

**Testing and Validation**

The generated code undergoes thorough testing and validation to ensure its correctness and reliability. The testing process involves:

1. Unit testing: Individual components of the code are tested independently.
2. Integration testing: Components are integrated to test their functionality as a whole.
3. System testing: The entire system is tested to ensure it functions correctly.

**Code Generation Tools**

The project uses various code generation tools, including:

1. C++ template metaprogramming
2. Java generics
3. Python decorators
4. JavaScript ES6 syntax

These tools enable efficient and flexible code generation.

**Target Platforms**

The generated code is intended for deployment on various target platforms, including:

1. Linux-based systems
2. Windows-based systems
3. Mobile devices (iOS, Android)

The code is designed to be platform-agnostic and can run on multiple operating systems and hardware architectures.

**Security Considerations**

The project includes security considerations to ensure the generated code meets relevant security standards and regulations. The code includes:

1. Data encryption
2. Access control mechanisms
3. Secure communication protocols

These measures are implemented to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
