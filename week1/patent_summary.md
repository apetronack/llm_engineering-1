## Abstract
The patent outlines various embodiments for controlled operation of an intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) system that breaks up calcified lesions in anatomical conduits. The focus is on control arrangements aimed at managing and terminating the provision of electrical energy to generate electrical arcs between spaced-apart electrodes submerged in a conductive fluid.

## Description
The invention addresses the challenges associated with intravascular lithotripsy, specifically issues related to energy application during procedures. It describes a control system that operates with a set of electrodes within a fluid-filled member, regulating electrical energy to produce effective pressure waves for the therapy. The system aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of IVL techniques by ensuring adequate power delivery without exceeding safe thresholds.

## Claims
The patent includes numerous claims indicating specific configurations and functionalities of the IVL system, such as:
1. An IVL system featuring electrodes, a voltage pulse generation system, and a control system managed by a processor.
2. The ability of the control system to adjust the pressure output across pressure waves and maintain it within predetermined upper and lower thresholds.
3. The described mechanisms address the incremental increase in voltage based on the effectiveness of previous applications.
4. A method for controlling the pressure output throughout treatment, ensuring a stable and effective operation for over 300 voltage pulses without decay in effectiveness.

Overall, the innovations promise to deliver improved outcomes in intravascular therapies while minimizing risks associated with high-energy applications.
