# Analyzing Hydrophone Data of Ultrasonic Acoustic Pulse

When analyzing hydrophone data of an ultrasonic acoustic pulse, such as a lithotripsy shock wave, there are several key considerations to ensure accurate measurement and interpretation of the data. 

## Determining the Acoustic Working Frequency

### Methodology:
To determine the acoustic working frequency of the pulse:

1. **Signal Acquisition:**
   Acquire the acoustic signal from the hydrophone and digitize the data using an appropriate sampling frequency.

2. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):**
   Perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the time-domain data to convert it to the frequency domain, which allows you to see the spectral content of the pulse.
   - **Windowing:** Apply a windowing technique (e.g., Hamming or Hann) to minimize edge effects when performing the FFT.

3. **Peak Frequency Identification:**
   Identify the frequency at which the maximum power spectral density occurs, which represents the acoustic working frequency of the pulse.

### Considerations:
- Ensure that the Nyquist frequency \( f_N \) (half the sampling frequency \( f_s \)) is greater than or equal to the expected acoustic frequency, which in many clinical cases may be in the range of 1-10 MHz.
- Given the sensitivity of the hydrophone varies with frequency, it’s crucial to ensure that the measured frequency range aligns with the provided sensitivity curve.

## Determining the Acoustic Pressure

### Signal Sampling Frequency and Nyquist Frequency:
1. **Necessary Sampling Frequency:**
   - Select a sampling frequency \( f_s \) that is at least twice the expected maximum frequency (Nyquist theorem). For instance, if the acoustic frequency is determined to be around 5 MHz, then \( f_s \) should be at least 10 MHz.

2. **Nyquist Frequency:**
   - The Nyquist frequency \( f_N \) = \( \frac{f_s}{2} \) must be sufficient to capture the frequency content of the acoustic pulse without aliasing.

### Applying Sensitivity Values:
1. **Fixed Sensitivity vs. Interpolation:**
   - **Fixed Sensitivity Value:** Using a fixed sensitivity value at the identified frequency can lead to simplified calculations, but this approach ignores the frequency-dependent nature of the hydrophone sensitivity. This can introduce inaccuracies if the transducer's working frequency has significant variation relative to the sensitivity curve.
   - **Interpolating Sensitivity Curve:** Interpolating the sensitivity curve across the detected frequency spectrum allows for a more accurate representation of the system, as it accounts for the discrete nature of the sensitivity data.

### Interpolation and Applying the Sensitivity Curve:

1. **Interpolating Sensitivity:**
   - Use interpolation techniques (linear, cubic spline) to estimate the sensitivity at the measured frequencies from the provided discrete sensitivity curve.
   - For each frequency in your spectrum, find the corresponding sensitivity value from the sensitivity curve.

2. **Applying Sensitivity to the Signal:**
   - Calculate the acoustic pressure by applying the interpolated sensitivities to the corresponding FFT magnitudes of the hydrophone signal.

### Signal Processing Techniques:
1. **Filtering:**
   - Implement band-pass filtering to isolate the relevant frequency components around the working frequency of the acoustic pulse, which helps in minimizing noise in the signal.

2. **Windowing:**
   - Use window functions prior to FFT to reduce spectral leakage and enhance frequency resolution.

### Example Python Script

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import find_peaks, butter, filtfilt
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def measure_acoustic_pressure(hydrophone_signal, fs, sensitivity_curve):
    # Parameters
    N = len(hydrophone_signal)
    t = np.arange(0, N) / fs
    f = np.fft.rfftfreq(N, d=1/fs)

    # FFT to get frequency domain representation
    hydrophone_fft = np.fft.rfft(hydrophone_signal)
    magnitude = np.abs(hydrophone_fft)

    # Identify the dominant frequency
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(magnitude)
    dominant_freq_index = peaks[np.argmax(magnitude[peaks])]
    f_dominant = f[dominant_freq_index]

    # Interpolating the sensitivity curve
    frequencies = np.arange(0, max(sensitivity_curve[0])+0.5, 0.5)  # Frequencies in MHz
    sensitivity_values = sensitivity_curve[1]  # Sensitivity (dB re. 1V/µPa)
    sensitivity_interp = interp1d(frequencies, sensitivity_values, bounds_error=False, fill_value="extrapolate")
    interpolated_sensitivity = sensitivity_interp(f)

    # Convert dB to voltage sensitivity
    voltage_sensitivity = 10**(interpolated_sensitivity / 20)

    # Calculate pressure
    acoustic_pressure = magnitude / voltage_sensitivity

    return f_dominant, acoustic_pressure, t

# Example hydrophone data and sensitivity curve inputs
fs = 20e6  # 20 MHz sampling frequency
hydrophone_signal = ...  # Input signal (V), needs to be provided
sensitivity_curve = (np.array([1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5]), np.array([-174, -169, -165, -160]))  # Example sensitivity curve

f_dominant, acoustic_pressure, time = measure_acoustic_pressure(hydrophone_signal, fs, sensitivity_curve)

# Plotting acoustic pressure
plt.plot(time, acoustic_pressure)
plt.title('Acoustic Pressure over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Acoustic Pressure (µPa)')
plt.show()
```

## Method to Validate the Accuracy of Acoustic Pressure Measurement

### Validation Method:
1. **Comparison to Known Standards:**
   - Measure acoustic pulses using a calibrated hydrophone or pressure standard to establish a reference pressure. Compare the measured acoustic pressures against these established values.

2. **Multiple Trials:**
   - Conduct multiple trials under consistent conditions and assess the repeatability and consistency of the measurements.

3. **Use of Different Hydrophone Models:**
   - Utilize hydrophones with different characteristics to corroborate measurements obtained and analyze variations in sensitivity to ensure robustness.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conduct statistical analysis on the measured pressures to evaluate variability and standard deviations to assess reliability.

By carefully following these methodologies and considerations, one can ensure accurate analysis of hydrophone data for ultrasonic acoustic pulses.
